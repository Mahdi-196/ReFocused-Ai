# ReFocused-AI Training Cleanup Summary

## âœ… What Was Cleaned Up

### **Removed Legacy Files**
- `run_optimized_training.sh` â†’ Replaced with simple `run.sh`
- `run_test_training.sh` â†’ Replaced with simple `run.sh`
- `run_production_training.sh` â†’ Replaced with simple `run.sh`  
- `test_dataloader.py` â†’ Functionality moved to main script
- `test_fsdp_setup.py` â†’ FSDP complexity removed
- `inspect_npz_files.py` â†’ Debugging moved to `debug_gpu.py`
- `COMMANDS.md` â†’ Information moved to README
- `configure_accelerate.sh` â†’ No longer needed
- `accelerate_config.yaml` â†’ Simplified accelerator setup
- `scripts/show_optimizations.py` â†’ Removed complex optimizations

### **Simplified Code**
- **train.py**: Reduced from 498 lines to ~150 lines
- **training_config.py**: Simplified configurations, removed complex options
- **setup.sh**: Streamlined installation process
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite with clear, accurate information

### **Removed Complexity**
- FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) - unnecessary for 1.2B model
- Complex preprocessing optimizations  
- Extensive monitoring and profiling systems
- Multiple configuration layers
- Legacy compatibility code

## ðŸŽ¯ What Remains (Essential Only)

### **Core Files**
- `train.py` - Clean, simple training script
- `setup.sh` - Minimal environment setup
- `run.sh` - Simple training launcher
- `debug_gpu.py` - GPU diagnostics tool
- `README.md` - Clear documentation

### **Configuration**
- `configs/model_config.py` - 1.2B model architecture
- `configs/training_config.py` - Simple test/production configs

### **Utilities**  
- `utils/data_utils.py` - Data loading essentials
- `utils/checkpoint_utils.py` - Basic checkpointing
- `utils/training_utils.py` - Core training utilities

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Cleanup

### **Simplicity**
- 70% reduction in code complexity
- Single entry point for training
- Clear file structure
- No confusing options

### **Maintainability**
- Easy to understand and modify
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies
- Good documentation

### **Reliability**
- Fewer moving parts = fewer bugs
- Focus on core functionality
- Better error handling
- Clearer debugging

## ðŸ“‹ New Workflow

### **Setup (One Time)**
```bash
bash setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Training**
```bash
# Quick test
python train.py --config test

# Full training  
python train.py --config production

# Using launcher
bash run.sh test
```

### **Debugging**
```bash
python debug_gpu.py
```

---

**Result**: A clean, maintainable, and easy-to-understand training setup that focuses on what actually matters for training the 1.2B model.
